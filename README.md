# Collect Unsubscribe Links (In Development)
## Description
This program will parse through your emails and collect a list of unsubscribe links and output them into a CSV, XLSX (Excel) or JSON.

Unlike some tools which you may come across on the internet we do not store any of your details, and this is why this tool needs to be downloaded and run manually.

The program will require you to enter your email address and password and then will parse through each email in your inbox looking for unsubscribe links. It will collect each link and output them into a file.

The program will not however click on each link for you attempting to unsubscribe on your behalf. This is done purely to prevent clicking on unsafe links. The file therefore will contain the sender email as well to help you search for the email should you wish to check the email before clicking on any link.
